# Landing Page Project

This is a **Landing Page** project I created for **learning purposes**. I built it as a hands-on way to strengthen my skills with **HTML**, **CSS**, **Sass**, **React** and **TypeScript (TSX)**. The project serves as a clean and simple example of a fully responsive landing page with a structured layout, making it a great practice tool for frontend development.

## Why I Built This Project

I wanted to improve my ability to create responsive and visually appealing web pages with reusable React components and organized, maintainable styles. By building this project, I gained experience with some essential web development technologies, and it’s a great example to share on GitHub for others who might be interested in similar practice projects.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: To create the structure and content of the page.
- **CSS**: Alongside Sass, to style the layout and ensure responsiveness.
- **Sass**: For powerful styling features, like variables, mixins, and nesting.
- **React**: To structure the page as reusable UI components.
- **TypeScript (TSX)**: To write type-safe, efficient React components.


## Page Structure

Here’s what the landing page includes:

1. **Header / Navigation**: A logo and navigation links for smooth scrolling to sections.
2. **Hero Section**: A welcoming section with a title, a brief tagline, and a call-to-action button.
3. **Features Section**: Highlights key features of the product/service.
4. **About Section**: Provides some background information on the company or offering.
5. **Services Section**: Lists available services or products.
6. **Testimonials Section**: Shows feedback from clients or users.
7. **Contact Section**: A simple contact form for users to reach out.
8. **Footer**: Contains copyright information.
